# Go vs Python Comparison
## Language purpose/genesis
### Go
  Go was designed by engineers at google with the purpose of creating a language that would resolve a lot of common criticisms of popular languages while maintaining the strengths that had made them so popular. Some specific goals for Go were creating a language that supported static typing and was easily scalable like Java, didn't require a lot of boilerplate like Ruby or Python, and - what I see as the most powerful aspect of go - had good support for networking and multiprocessing. The creation of Go was certainly a reaction to shortfalls the creators saw with a lot of contemporary languages, especially C++.

### Python
